# jvim
Jedi vim. This is an an ide specially made for jedi and ptyhon and me. Feel free to us it as you wish.

As a disclaimer, this is the first time I have compile using gcc. 
I create this document for myself as it may be that I never cross compile again.
I want to be able to avoid as many pitfalls as possible, that I encountered on my first attempt.
If this helps others avoid some pitfalls, that's great too.

I have been frustrated with the tutorials I have seen on this. Not one took me to the completion
of the task at hand. I peiced together a working system for vim myself. I prymarily prefer 
python but I am imbarking on a journed to create a custom vim ide to meet my preferences.

That being said this repository may not be for you. But if you are having trouble in 
this task, it is my sencere hope that at least I can help you move forward.

1. find a directory you want to work in. I created c:\users\user\workspace\vim when I did this.
2. in vim, ""
